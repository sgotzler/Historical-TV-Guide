### Project History

In August of 2011, Newman directed Gotzler in the creation of a tabular database of 1950s television shows based on entries in a TV encyclopedia. 

In 2017 Newman and Gotzler were awarded an Andrew W. Mellon Digital Humanities Seed grant to update and improve the database using digital tools for a project that was initially titled the “Television Mega-Text.”

During the duration of that grant (2017-2018) Gotzler and Daniel Evans, a digital developer, worked closely together to gather and merge data from the internet archive and IMDB, creating an extensive and detailed dataset of 1950s U.S.television programming information. They met regularly with Newman, DH consultant Scott Weingart, and Emma Slayton, who helped with data visualization.Initial analysis was conducted using python3 in Jupyter Notebooks, and examined working-class content in Action & Adventure programs, and Newman and Gotzler presented the project and preliminary findings at the Society for Cinema and Media Studies (SCMS) annual conference in March, 2018. 

In the multiverse of DH projects, this is a database project. Our ultimate goal is to build a publicly accessible database that allows for searching by keywords, data analysis and visualizations.
