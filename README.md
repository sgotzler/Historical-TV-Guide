Welcome to the *Historical TV Guide*!

This project is an attempt to aggregate data about television in the 1950s. Only 5-10% of what was broadcast has been preserved, and much of this was done on kinescope technology that has also been subject to significant deterioration. Our goal then, is to use digital tools and available textual data sources to reconstruct a rich and accessible historical record that might do justice to the range and character of television programming broadcast during the early decades of TV. 

In the initial phases of our study, we wanted to find a way to show that 1950s television was more diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, and social class than we have remembered it to be. Contrary to conventional wisdom, television in the 1950s was weird and heterogeneous, full of working class characters and themes, and ideologically diverse as well. Following television scholar Horace Newcomb, we hoped to argue that television during the 1950s functioned primarily as a cultural forum—a place where “meaningful difference” could be confronted, negotiated and explored—rather than as an ideological monolith or cultural leveler.

To access the dataset please visit our *deposit* on KiltHub, Carnegie Mellon University's institutional repository, and feel free to check out the project's repo on GitHub at the links below. 

The GitHub repo also contains the jupyter notebooks from our preliminary analysis of working-class content in the Action & Adventure genre.

### About the Project

In August of 2011, Newman directed Gotzler in the creation of a tabular database of 1950s television shows based on entries in a TV encyclopedia. 

In 2017 Newman and Gotzler were awarded an Andrew W. Mellon Digital Humanities Seed grant to update and improve the database using digital tools for a project that was initially titled the “Television Mega-Text.”

During the duration of the Mellon grant (2017-2018) Gotzler and Daniel Evans, a digital developer, worked closely together to gather and merge data from the internet archive and IMDB, creating an extensive and detailed dataset of 1950s U.S.television programming information. They met regularly with Newman, DH consultant Scott Weingart, and Emma Slayton, who helped with data visualization.Initial analysis was conducted using python3 in Jupyter Notebooks, and examined working-class content in Action & Adventure programs, and Newman and Gotzler presented the project and preliminary findings at the Society for Cinema and Media Studies (SCMS) annual conference in March, 2018. 

In the multiverse of DH projects, this is a database project. Our ultimate goal is to build a publicly accessible database that allows for searching by keywords, data analysis and visualizations.
